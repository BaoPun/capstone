### Running on "Open Application Lists" Option on the Navigation Drawer
- To get to this, open the navigation drawer on the main window located on the top left
- Click on the 5th item - Open Application Lists
- Whether or not you want to load previous layouts, press Yes or No (if you're a first time user, don't expect any loaded layouts)
- To add an application, either press the = Key or touch/click the ADD button.  This will open up a new form.
- The form contains 3 entries, two of which are required, as denoted by a *
- The 3 entries in order: the application location (required), the image location (optional), and the hotkey (required, alphanumeric, no differentiation between uppercase and lowercase, and ONLY 1 character)
- In addition, only the third textbox can be inputted by the user (the other two textboxes are read-only). 
- Fill out the two required textbox fields, and press the Submit button to see your new application on the window.
- To run the newly added application(s), simply Left Click on its corresponding button, touch it if your computer is touch-compatible, or tap on the assigned key (the tap option requires the window to be in focus).
- To delete the button, right click on it and then press the Remove option
- To edit the hotkey on the button, right click on it and then press the Edit Hotkey option
- If you change your mind about removing or editing the button, simply press Cancel or anywhere on the window that isn't the remove nor the edit button.
- Each button will also have tool tips
- You can also touch/click and hold the MOVE button to drag the Window and still not have the window be in focus
- To force focus onto the Window, simply tap anywhere within the window except for the buttons
- If you want to save your layouts w/o quitting, then simply use Ctrl S
- Another way to quit the application, besides clicking on the X button or using the Alt F4 keystroke, is to use the keystroke Ctrl Q.  This implementation is made to help MAC users, since their method of quitting applications is via COMMAND Q.
